                            <p>Originating from Varanasi (formerly Banaras), these sarees are known for their gold and
                                silver brocade or <span class="gold-accent">zari work</span>. The intricate designs
                                often feature floral, foliate patterns,
                                and the use of meenakari (colorful enamel work).</p>
                            <p>These sarees hold special significance in Indian weddings and are often passed down as
                                heirlooms through generations. The creation of a single Banarasi saree can take anywhere
                                from 15 days to 6 months depending on the complexity of design.</p>

                            <p>Hailing from Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, these silk sarees are characterized by their

                                colors, heavy gold zari work, and contrasting borders. Traditional motifs include temple

                            <p>Kanjivaram sarees are woven using pure mulberry silk threads. The body and border of the
                                saree are woven separately and then interlocked, a technique known as <span

                <div class="text-main-content">
                    <p>The creation of a handloom saree involves several intricate steps:</p>

                    <ol class="numbered-list">
                        <li><strong>Yarn Processing:</strong> The silk or cotton threads are prepared, dyed, and made
                            ready
                            for weaving.</li>
                        <li><strong>Designing:</strong> Artisans create patterns either freehand or using graph paper.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Warping:</strong> The vertical threads (warp) are arranged on the loom.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weft Insertion:</strong> The horizontal threads (weft) are interlaced with the warp
                            to
                            create the fabric.</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Techniques:</strong> Depending on the saree type, techniques like jacquard,
                            jamdani, or zari work are employed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> The saree is washed, pressed, and made ready for sale.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This meticulous process can take anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on the
                        complexity of the design and techniques used.</p>

                <div class="text-main-content">
                    <p>Traditional handloom saree weaving is facing challenges from power looms and machine-made
                        textiles.
                        At <span class="gold-accent">11Sari</span>, we're committed to preserving this artform by:</p>
